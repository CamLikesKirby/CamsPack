         I made everything else

         QNA:

         Q: did you make this for/work for [insert youtuber]

         A: no I make these for fun but it's good to see youtubers covering my mod

         Q: Can you add [tower idea]

         A: Maybe it depends on the idea

         Q: Why are there so many 2D towers and why are the towers blurry

         A: I don't know how to code in models or make them and they're blurry because I have to shrink them so the towers aren't big this might be changed in the future

         Q: You didn't make [insert tower] idea

         A: I did. I would have credited it if not

         Q: Why do the 2D towers rotate weirdly

         A: idk and I don't know how to fix that

         Q: Why is the mod so bad

         A: I tried my best I don't really know C# so the quality of my mod won't be as good as other modders
