I made everything else

QNA:

Q: did you make this for/work for [insert youtuber]

A: no I make these for fun but it's good to see youtubers covering my mod

Q: Can you add [tower idea]

A: Maybe it depends on the idea

Q: Why is the dark monkey not dark

A: the texture wasn't working for some reason you can look at it [here](https://github.com/CamtheKirby/CamsPack/blob/main/Assets/DarkMonkey-Img/DarkMonkeyDisplay.png)

Q: Why are there so many 2D towers and why are the towers blurry

A: I don't know how to code in models or make them and they're blurry because I have to shrink them so the towers aren't big this might be changed in the future

Q: You didn't make [insert tower] idea

A: I did. I would have credited it if not

Q: Why do the 2D towers rotate weirdly

A: idk and I don't know how to fix that

Q: Why is your so bad

A: I tried my best I don't really know C# so the quality of my mod won't be as good as other modders
